This code is for a simple web enabled relay and sensor for opening/closing a garage door and monitoring whether it's open or closed using a reed relay.

It also includes a simple REST API

This code is based on examples from:
- Debasis Parida/Circuit Digest: https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/ajax-with-esp8266-dynamic-web-page-update-without-reloading
- Renzo Mischianti: https://www.mischianti.org/2020/05/16/how-to-create-a-rest-server-on-esp8266-and-esp32-startup-part-1/?
